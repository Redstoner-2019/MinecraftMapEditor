## About this project

This is a tool for Minecraft, written in Java.

Using this you can generate a map of key waypoints and intersections for a nether hub, including:

- Portals
- Tunnels (current & under construction)
- Tunnel intersections

It provides a user interface for entering points of interest, which are then added to the map.
